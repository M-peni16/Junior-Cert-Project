		<h1> The Impact on Animals</h1>
		<p> We have spoken a lot on the impact of humans but sometimes</P>
		<p> we forget the animals who breath the same air, drink the same water and walk on the same soil as us </p>
		<h2> Animals </h2>
		<h3> As we previously mentioned, a rise in sea level is an impact of climate change. This leads to the destruction of many animal habitats </h3>
		<h3> Warming oceans can also ruin the lives of many sea creatures </h3>
		<h3> In places like the Amazon rain forest which houses many species like the macaw, the jaguar and the black spider monkey, warmer temperature only leads to problems </h3>
		<h3> Droughts happen more frequently and as a result so many animals have no home, food or even water!</h3>
		<h2> How to help animals and their homes </h2>
		<h3> Express your anger about this topic </h3> <!--Each H represents a different title size-->
		<h3> Adopt an animal </h3>
		<h3> Pay money to shelters that help those animals </h3>
		<h3> Go meatless once a week </h3>
