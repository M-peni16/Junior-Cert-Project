		<h1> Political and Media Impact </h1>
		<p> It has been brought to attention lately about the power of media influence on climate change <p>
		<P> It has become a very topical situation </p>
		<h2> What effect does the media have on the future?</h2>
		<h3> A study from a Yale program on climate change claims only 71% of Americans believe in Climate Change! </h3>  
		<h3> Some believe climate change is definitely happening while others refuse to acknowledge it! </h3>
		<h2> Political Influence </h2>
		<h3> During Donald Trump's presidency, a concerning number of people have come out to claim climate change in non-existent.<h3>
		<h3> This not only impacts the current situation but has a knock on effect on generations to come who may not have even been able vote during this election. </h3>
		<h3> When asked about the growing issue and the 1,600-page National Climate Assessment, Trump simply answered "I don't believe it". “I’ve seen it. I’ve read some of it. It’s fine,"</h3>
		<h3> "Right now we’re at the cleanest we’ve ever been. It’s very important to me,"</h3>
		<h3> A person with such a large and very influential following, what Trump is saying is dangerous. </h3>
		<h3> This is why we must be smart with our news sources, ensure they are not bias and be smart with problems as big as climate change </h3>
